# Visual data exploration

This is an **exploration** about candidate's campaign finance data by using several **data visualization** concepts from the book [*Fundamentals of Data visualization*](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html). The data set has 26828 rows and 50 columns, which is a combination of candidate summary file from year 2008 to 2020 obtained from the U.S. Federal Election Commission ([FEC](https://www.fec.gov/)). Each summary file covers for a two year period of candidate's financial activity summary. For more detailed file description, please visit: <https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/candidate-summary-file-description/>.

### Part 1. Figures with stories

In Part 1, several data representations were created along with corresponding stories. The figures presented conveyed messages extracted from the data set and were useful in the exploratory data analysis process. It is believed that, when used properly, data visualization can help to facilitate understanding of the data set by providing intuitive insights.

### Part 2. Misleading figures

In part 2 of this project, two figures from part 1 were transformed and presented in a way that conveyed different messages. While these figures were technically accurate, they may have been misleading to some viewers who did not examine them carefully. This exercise demonstrated the importance of carefully considering how data is represented, as not all data representations can clearly convey the intended message. By understanding the potential for figures to be misleading, we can better avoid them in the future.
