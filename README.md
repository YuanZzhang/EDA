# Visual data exploration

This is an **exploration** about candidate's campaign finance data by using a few **data visualization** concepts from the book [*Fundamentals of Data visualization*](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html). The data set has 26828 rows and 50 columns, which is a combination of candidate summary file from year 2008 to 2020 obtained from the U.S. Federal Election Commission ([FEC](https://www.fec.gov/)). Each summary file covers for a two year period of candidate's financial activity summary. For more detailed file description, please visit: <https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/candidate-summary-file-description/>. 


### Part 1. Figures with stories

A few data representations are created along with corresponding stories. Figures convey story messages extracted from the data set, and they are helpful in the exploratory data analysis. If used properly, data visualization can help understanding the data set with more intuitions.


### Part 2. Misleading figures

Not all data representations can convey the story messages clearly. In part 2, two figures in part 1 are transformed, and they tell different stories that may not reflect the truth in the data set. Although these two figures are technically right, their stories can be misleading to many people who don't look at them carefully.

(All figures are created in r with packages)
